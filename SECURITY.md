- Regular cleanup of temporary files

### Configuration Security

#### Secure Defaults
```bash
# Recommended secure configuration
./vulscan https://target.com \
    --threads 3 \
    --timeout 15 \
    --output secure-$(date +%Y%m%d).json
```

#### Environment Security
- No credentials stored in configuration files
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Proper file permissions on reports (600)
- Secure temporary file handling

## 📚 Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Pre-Scanning
1. ✅ **Obtain proper authorization** before scanning
2. ✅ **Review target's security policy** and terms of service
3. ✅ **Start with low thread counts** to minimize impact
4. ✅ **Use test environments** when possible
5. ✅ **Notify target administrators** if required

#### During Scanning
1. 🔍 **Monitor scan progress** and system impact
2. ⏸️ **Pause scanning** if issues arise
3. 📊 **Use appropriate thread counts** for target capacity
4. 🛡️ **Respect rate limits** and security controls
5. 📝 **Document scan parameters** and findings

#### Post-Scanning
1. 🔒 **Secure scan results** with appropriate permissions
2. 📧 **Report critical vulnerabilities** promptly
3. 🗑️ **Clean up temporary files** and logs
4. 📋 **Follow up** on remediation progress
5. 🔄 **Re-scan** after fixes are implemented

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
```go
// Example: Secure HTTP client configuration
func createSecureClient() *http.Client {
    return &http.Client{
        Timeout: 30 * time.Second,
        Transport: &http.Transport{
            TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
                MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
                CipherSuites: []uint16{
                    tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
                    tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,
                },
            },
            MaxIdleConns:        100,
            MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 10,
            IdleConnTimeout:     90 * time.Second,
        },
    }
}
```

#### Input Validation
```go
// Example: Safe URL validation
func validateURL(rawURL string) error {
    u, err := url.Parse(rawURL)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("invalid URL: %w", err)
    }
    
    if u.Scheme != "http" && u.Scheme != "https" {
        return errors.New("only HTTP/HTTPS URLs are supported")
    }
    
    if u.Host == "" {
        return errors.New("URL must have a valid host")
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

#### Error Handling
```go
// Example: Secure error handling
func handleScanError(err error, url string) {
    // Log error without exposing sensitive information
    log.Printf("Scan error for %s: %v", sanitizeURL(url), err)
    
    // Don't expose internal errors to user
    fmt.Println("Scan failed. Check logs for details.")
}
```

- **Perfect Forward Secrecy** (PFS) support
- **Certificate validation** enabled by default

#### Random Number Generation
```go
// Secure random generation for tokens
func generateSecureToken(length int) (string, error) {
    bytes := make([]byte, length)
    if _, err := rand.Read(bytes); err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(bytes), nil
}
```

### Data Protection

#### At Rest
- Configuration files with restricted permissions (600)
- Temporary files cleaned up automatically
- No sensitive data in logs or outputs
- Optional report encryption for sensitive scans

#### In Transit
